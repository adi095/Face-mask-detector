# Face-mask-detector
The main aim of this project is to detect correct usage of face masks on human faces. In addition to using masks ,correct usage of mask is also necessary covering mouth and nose.  A dataset using Kaggle was built then a classifier model based on neural networks was deployed using Mobilenet V2. A class of light weight  deep convolutions neural network in order to classify the images. Mobilenet V2 was implemented in Tensorflow and Keras. Framework of Caffe model was used an ultimately real time detection was done using open CV.
